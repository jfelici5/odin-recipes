    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This dish is a super healthy snack that will add value to <em>any</em> dish.
        Although it is sometimes too gritty in texture and might have a certain weird
        taste, it has health effects that reach far beyond what you would expect, and
        it has a certain knack for raising the level of the ingredients around it
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 defensive greens</li>
        <li>4 onion rings</li>
        <li>5 tbsp of "AND ONEEE" sauce</li>
        <li>3 chicken leg (kicks)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the defensive greens, scrubbing out as much grit as possible</li>
        <li>Add the greens to a pan, cook on high heat</li>
        <li>When the greens have reduced, add the 3 chicken legs in a flailing motion</li>
        <li>Add the onion rings upon completion of the legs, stir until crispy</li>
        <li>Serve with AND ONEEE sauce and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
